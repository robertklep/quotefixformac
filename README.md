## _Important notice_

I decided to not accept requests for new features for the time being, primarily due to lack of time. Any feature requests will be closed (but tagged so if things quiet down, I can reopen them).

However, do keep submitting bug reports. I'll try and fix them as fast as I can.

## FAQ

See [the wiki](https://github.com/robertklep/quotefixformac/wiki/FAQ---Frequently-Asked-Questions).

## What is it?

QuoteFix is a plug-in for Mail.app which fixes some issues with replying to
e-mail:

* it tries to remove the signature from the original message;
* it removes certain unnecessary empty lines;
* it positions the cursor below the original message, instead of above it (in other words, bottom-posting instead of top-posting);
* it can (optionally) prune nested quotes from a specific level and above;

It also provides customized attributions for replies and forwards.

## Installation

Installation is provided through simple shell scripts, courtesy of <a href="https://myjeeva.com">Jeevanandam M.</a>

1. Provide permission to "Terminal.app" for installing the QuoteFix plugin:
    - Go to _"System Preferences > Security & Privacy  Privacy"_
    - Unlock, if needed, bt clicking the lock icon in the lower left corner
    - Select _"Full Disk Access or Application Data"_
    - Click the "+" icon
    - Select _"Terminal.app"_ and click _"Add"_
    - Note: Terminal.app has to be restarted for changes to take effect
2. Double click or run <code>Install-or-Upgrade-or-Reenable.command</code>
3. Enable the QuoteFix plugin in Mail.app:
    - Go to _"Mail > Preferences > General"_
    - Click the _"Manage Plug-ins"_ button
    - Check _"QuoteFix.mailbundle"_
    - Click the _"Apply and Restart Mail.app"_ button

In case you run into any problems, or want to uninstall QuoteFix, double click or run the `Uninstall.command` script. You can also remove `QuoteFix.mailbundle` from the Mail bundle folder.

## Usage

After installation, QuoteFix is enabled. It will perform its magic automatically when you reply to, or forward, messages.

The behaviour of the plug-in is customizable via its preferences. QuoteFix has it's own preference pane in the preferences window of Mail.app. Most preferences speak for themselves, or have a useful tooltip which pops up when you hover the cursor above it.

If you temporarily want to turn off QuoteFix, but don't want to uninstall it, check off the *QuoteFix is enabled* checkbox. As of version 2.3.1, (de)activating QuoteFix can be done from a menu item in the Mail menu. You could use [the standard way of assigning a keyboard shortcut to a menu item in Mac OS X](http://lifehacker.com/343328/create-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-any-menu-action-in-any-program) to enable or disable QuoteFix with a keyboard shortcut.

## Customized Attributions

QuoteFix also provides the ability to define your own attribution lines (the first line of a reply/forward, usually looking something like `On SOME DATE, at SOME TIME, SOMEONE wrote:`).

Customized attributions work by way of templates: you define a template in the preferences, and parts of the template will – at the time of replying or forwarding – be replaced by values reflecting parts of the message you are replying to or forwarding.

Templating works by replacing template variables with values. A template variable looks like this: `${VARIABLE}`. It will be replaced with a value depending on what `VARIABLE` contains.

A (non-exhaustive) list of variables you can use:

<table border=0>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.from}</code></td>
        <td>
            Name and e-mail address of sender of message:<br/>
            <i>Your Friend &lt;yourfriend@example.com&gt;</i>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.from.name}</code></td>
        <td>
            Name of sender of message:<br/>
            <i>Your Friend</i>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.from.email}</code></td>
        <td>
            E-mail address of sender of message:<br/>
            <i>yourfriend@example.com</i>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.to}</code></td>
        <td>
            Your e-mail address (this is the address that was used for
            the message to reach you). This is more like the
            <code>Delivered-To</code> header than the <code>To</code>
            header (for that, see <code>${message.recipients}</code>)
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.recipients}</code></td>
        <td>
            A list of all the recipients of the message, as mentioned in
            both the <code>To</code> and <code>Cc</code> headers.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.recipients.to}</code></td>
        <td>
            A list of the recipients of the message mentioned in
            the <code>To</code> header.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.recipients.cc}</code></td>
        <td>
            A list of the recipients of the message mentioned in
            the <code>Cc</code> header.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>${message.subject}</code></td>
        <td>The subject of the message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">
            <code>${message.sent}</code><br/>
            <code>${message.received}</code>
        </td>
        <td>
            Sent/received timestamps. If you want more finegrained
            control over formatting timestamps, these variables split
            into separate fields: <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>,
            <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>hour12</code>,
            <code>ampm</code>, <code>minute</code>, <code>second</code>,
            <code>weeknumber</code>, <code>monthshort</code>,
            <code>monthlong</code>, <code>dayshort</code>,
            <code>daylong</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>time</code>.<br/>
            Use these like so: <code>${message.sent.year}</code>.
            <p><a href="#advanced-datetime-formatting">See below for more advanced date/time formatting
                options.</a></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

If you want even more freedom in formatting attribution lines, there's an experimental feature (which can be enabled in the *Advanced* preferences) which enables conditional statements, string/date formatting, and much more. This is based on a modified version of the [pyratemp](http://www.simple-is-better.org/template/pyratemp.html) templating library for Python written by Roland Koebler.

A small example of what's possible:
```
From: ${message.from}
{% if message.recipients.to %}
 To: ${message.recipients.to.join("; ", "name")}
{% end %}
{% if message.recipients.cc %}
 Cc: ${message.recipients.cc.join("; ", "name")}
{% end %}
Subject: ${message.subject.lower()}
Sent-Date: ${message.sent.strftime("%d-%m-%Y")}
```

You can also enable HTML-formatting for your custom attributions. For this to work, the (outgoing) message format should be *Rich Text*. You can have QuoteFix automatically convert a message to Rich Text if your attribution should be interpreted in HTML. Otherwise, QuoteFix will issue a warning.

If you want to mimic the attribution generated by Outlook, try this (with HTML-formatting enabled):
```
<b>From:</b> ${message.from}
<b>Date:</b> ${message.received}
<b>To:</b> ${message.to}
<b>Subject:</b> ${message.subject}
```
When you're editing your customized attribution, QuoteFix will generate an approximate preview as tooltip of the text field you're entering the attribution in.

## Advanced date/time formatting

If you want even more finegrained control over the formatting of dates and times, you can enable *"advanced templating"* in the Advanced preferences, after which date/time variables like `message.sent` and `message.received` will have `.format()` and `.strftime()` methods with which you can format the output of the objects.

Functionally, these two methods perform the same operation – namely formatting date/time objects – the difference is in the formatting strings used:

*  `.strftime()` uses the common Unix function with the same name for formatting. [Look here for more information](http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime).
*  `.format()` uses the Unicode date format patterns. [Look here for more information](http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-10.html#Date_Format_Patterns).

An example:
```
${message.sent.format("EEE MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss")}
```
This will output: `Sun Nov 06 2011 10:19:34`

Similarly, with `.strftime()`:
```
${message.sent.strftime("%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S")}
```

However: the output will be generated in the current locale, which means that it will be formatted according to your local language settings.

To change this, both methods accept a second argument: a locale identifier. You can use it to convert the output to a certain locale, instead of the default locale (which can be changed in the *System Preferences* of Mac OS X: *Language & Text > Formats*).

The same example as above, but with a different locale:
```
${message.sent.format("EEE MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss", 'fr_FR')}
```
The output: `dim. nov. 06 2011 10:19:34`

If you want the default format, just in a different locale, use the `.locale()` method:
```
${message.sent.locale('fr_FR')}
```

## Enabling/disabling the plug-in

QuoteFix has various ways of turning off its behaviour, short of uninstalling it:

* You can turn QuoteFix off from its preferences; this will disable the plug-in until you enable it again;
* You can quickly turn the plug-in on/off from the Mail menu. If you want, you can even assign a keyboard shortcut to this menu item from System Preferences;
* You can toggle the enable (or disable) status of QuoteFix for a single message by pressing down `Option` whilst initiating a Reply/Forward action. That is:
    * When QuoteFix is **disabled**, pressing `Option` will *enable* QuoteFix for that particular message only;
    * Likewise: when QuoteFix is **enabled**, pressing `Option` will *disable* QuoteFix for that particular message only;

## Building the plug-in

If you want to build the plug-in yourself, ideally you need to use a non-system Python interpreter (although not *strictly* necessary if you want to use the plug-in on your system only).

I use Python 2.7.5 as installed by [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). I also use [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/) to create a clean environment in which to build the plug-in.

Make sure the following requirements are installed:
```
pip install pyobjc # might take some time
pip install py2app
```

Next, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/robertklep/quotefixformac.git
```

And build the plug-in:
```
cd quotefixformac
python setup.py py2app
```

This will build the plug-in, which can be located in `dist/`.
